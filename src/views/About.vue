                  <v-icon color="mdLight" class="mr-3">mdi-numeric-2-circle</v-icon>Casual clothing only. We save the special attire for Friday and Saturday nights.

                  <v-icon color="mdLight" class="mr-3">mdi-numeric-3-circle</v-icon>(insert another useless rule here)
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Now that formalities are out of the way, let me introduce myself. My name is Natcha Pradappet and I like to design stuff. I’ll design anything from logos to websites and apps to XD for
                just over a year. Even though my Illustrator and XD experience is short, I can still create a mean vector using just the pen tool. kitchen cabinets. I’m especially good Adobe graphic
                software, including
                <span
                  class="flatSunflower--text"
                >Illustrator</span>,
                <span class="flatPeterriver--text">Photoshop</span>, and
                <span class="info--text">XD</span>. I’ve been using
                Photoshop for over 15 years, Illustrator for about 2 years, and
              </p>
              <p>
                I don’t have any formal education in graphic design or UI/UX, though. I learned everything I know through late-night research and studying. I watch a lot of Adobe streams on YouTube
                and learn something new all the time. Much credit goes to my mother, Nava. She was born in Thailand and got her first job at an advertising agency there. She was one of the two first
                designer/artists who started with the company, and eventually grew the agency to become one of Bangkok’s most successful companies. She eventually moved to the US to raise me, and in
                turn taught me design and style at a very young age. I actually started building webpages from the age of 13; before we even had CSS. At the time, my mom attended graphic design
                classes at our local community college and would teach me Photoshop when she came home.
              </p>
              <p>
                But then my hard drive failed, and I lost everything. I was wrecked. Devastated. I had no more motivation to continue web development. So, I turned to Starcraft, and played that holy
                game for nearly 18 hours a day.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduating high school, I decided to study business marketing, a decision influenced by my mom’s experience in the advertising industry. I continued my education and received my
                Master’s in Business Administration a few years later. Hindsight is 20/20, though. After I graduated, I realized that I really hate advertisements and commercials. The idea of trying
                to persuade people to buy things that they may not need seemed kind of shady to me. (Now, if you’re thinking, “But hey! Your mom did advertising!” Well, then you’re right. She did. But
                advertising techniques in Thailand are much different from here in the US. But that’s another topic.)
              </p>
              <p>So, now I’m back to building designing and building websites and apps. And I’m having such a great time doing so.</p>
