            <h2>MEETINGS AND CHECK-INS</h2>

            <p>We hate meetings just as much as you do, but we're not sure how we'd collaborate without them, so we'll try to get out of your hair ASAP. That being said, we respect your time, too, so please keep all lines of communication open if at all possible. We understand that life happens and hope that you'll show the same respect that you'd likely expect to receive.  </p>

            <li>Genuinely attempt to attend all meetings on time. We won't waste your time.</li>
            <li>Openly communicate about current status at all times. We don't need handholding, but it's important we're actively communicating. Expected response time: within 6-12 hours.</li>
            <li />
